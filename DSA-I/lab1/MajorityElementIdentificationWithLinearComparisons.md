Write a C program that takes a positive integer \(n\) and an array \(A\) of \(n\) integers as input and does the following. If there is an element which appears more than \(n/2\) times in the array \(A\), the program prints that element as output. Otherwise, the program prints "No Majority". Make sure the number of comparisons of your program is linear with respect to \(n\) and the additional space used is bounded by a constant, independent of the input.

Input format:

The first line of the input indicates the value of \(n\) and the next \(n\) lines display the list of \(n\) integers; one in each line. 

Output format:

If there is an element which appears more than \(n/2\) times in the array \(A\), the program prints that element as output. Otherwise, the program prints "No Majority".
