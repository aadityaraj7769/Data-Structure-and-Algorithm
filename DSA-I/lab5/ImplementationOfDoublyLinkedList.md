Write a C program to read a number \(n\) followed by \(n\) integers from the user and create a doubly linked list L from these elements. Traverse the elements of the list to first print its elements from front to back and then from back to front. Next, remove the first and the last elements of the list. Once again traverse the elements of the list to first print its elements from front to back and then from back to front.
