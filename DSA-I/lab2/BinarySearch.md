Write a C program to read a sorted array of \(n\) integers and implement binary search algorithm recursively. Take middle index as floor of \((left + right)/2\).

Input format: First line indicates \(n\), the number of elements in the array. The next \(n\) lines display the list of \(n\) integers; one in each line. The \((n+2)^{th}\) indicates the item to be searched in the array.

Output format: First line: The recursion depth = \(d\), where \(d\) is the maximum recursion depth encountered during the execution.

Second line: If item is present in the array, then the index position in the array, where the item was found. If the item is not present in the array, then -1.
