Write a C program to read five integers from the user and store them in a linked list \(L\) in the input order. You may not use dynamic memory allocation or any arrays.  Traverse the linked list and print its elements in the order as output. Next,  read a new integer \(x\) from the user. If there is no element in \(L\) which is greater than \(x\), then insert \(x\) to the last position of \(L\). Otherwise, insert \(x\) just before the first element in \(L\) which is greater than \(x\). Traverse the linked list again and print its elements in the order as output.
